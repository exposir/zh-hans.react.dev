<TeamMember name="Mengdi Chen" permalink="mengdi-chen" photo="/images/team/mengdi-chen.jpg" github="mondaychen" twitter="mengdi_en" title="Engineer at Meta">
    While working on his Digital Arts degree Mengdi was conceited about his front-end skills because his CSS worked perfectly even on IE6. But soon React opened a new door of programming for him, and he has been dreaming of joining the React team ever since. Outside of work, he is usually busy chasing his two kids around or collecting strange recipes.

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Markbåge" permalink="sebastian-markbåge" photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Silbermann" permalink="sebastian-silbermann" photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann" title="Independent Engineer">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Seth Webster" permalink="seth-webster" photo="/images/team/seth.jpg" github="sethwebster" twitter="sethwebster" personal="sethwebster.com" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

<TeamMember name="Sophie Alpert" permalink="sophie-alpert" photo="/images/team/sophiebits.jpg" github="sophiebits" twitter="sophiebits" personal="sophiebits.com" title="Independent Engineer">
    Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project's #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn't getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she's still in the team's group chats and “providing value”.

<TeamMember name="Tianyu Yao" permalink="tianyu-yao" photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.

<TeamMember name="Yuzhi Zheng" permalink="yuzhi-zheng" photo="/images/team/yuzhi.jpg" github="yuzhi" twitter="yuzhiz" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
